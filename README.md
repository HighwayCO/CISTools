Detailed mapping by domain from the ONG-C2M2 framework to the CIS Critical Security Controls (v8). The approach in this mapping is to align the purpose, overview, and objectives of the ONG-C2M2 framework to the prescriptive controls (safeguards) outlined in the CIS Critical Security Controls (v8). The control mapping format used is derived from the AuditScripts "CIS Controls: Master Mappings Tool" available in the "Free Resources" section on the AuditScripts website (Enclave Security, 2023). 

This control mapping will provide security practiitoners with a cross-platform and compliance framework blueprints for securing their organizations OT environemnt and maturing their overall cybersecurity program.
