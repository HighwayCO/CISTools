This control mapping contains a detailed mapping by domain from the Oil & Natural Gas Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model (ONG-C2M2) framework to the CIS Critical Security Controls (v8). The approach in this mapping is to align the purpose, overview, and objectives of the ONG-C2M2 framework to the prescriptive controls (safeguards) outlined in the CIS Critical Security Controls (v8). The control mapping format used is derived from the AuditScripts "CIS Controls: Master Mappings Tool" available in the "Free Resources" section on the AuditScripts website (Enclave Security, 2023). 

This control mapping will provide security practitioners with a cross-platform and compliance framework blueprints for securing their organizations OT environment and maturing their overall cybersecurity program. 

This control mapping was developed as a degree fulfillment requirement for the SANS Technology Institute's Master of Science in Information Security Management (MSISM) program.
